## Topics

-   Implicit and explicit coercion

-   Vectorization and recycling

-   Working with logical vectors

-   Subsetting: numeric and logical indexing

-   Useful functions for vectors

## Implicit coercion

-   Broadly speaking, **implicit coercion** is how R decides what type the output should be when combining or performing operations on different atomic types.

-   Implicit coercion is most commonly found in calculations with logical values and in vector creation using the combine `c()` function.

### Calculations with logical values

-   Logical values are automatically coerced to numeric when used in calculations.

```{r}

TRUE + 5     # TRUE becomes 1 so 1 + 5 = 6

FALSE + 5    # FALSE becomes 0 so 0 + 5 = 5

v <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
sum(v)    # 1 + 0 + 1 = 2
```

**Hands-On**

Guess the output in the following R code. Try the code to confirm your guess.

```{r}

TRUE * 2

FALSE * 2

v1 <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
sum(v1)

v2 <- c(F, T, F, F, T, F, T)
sum(v2)
```

**Answer:**

```{r}

### R code here
```

### Combining values with `c()`

-   Implicit coercion also occurs when we combine different atomic types into a single vector.

-   In this case, all elements are converted to the most complex type (character).

$$
\text{Character} \, > \, \text{Double} \, > \, \text{Integer} \, > \, \text{Logical}
$$

```{r}

c(4L, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)                   # integer > logical
 
c(7.3, 4L, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)              # double > integer > logical

c("eagles", 7.3, 4L, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)    # character > double > integer > logical
```

**Hands-On**

Guess the output in the following R code. Try the code to confirm your guess.

```{r}

v1 <- c(TRUE, 3.5, FALSE, 1L)
sum(v1)

v2 <- c(FALSE, TRUE, 2, 3, "4", 5L)
sum(v2)
```

**Answer:**

```{r}

### R code here
```

## Explicit coercion

-   **Explicit coercion** directly forces one atomic type to become another.

```{r}

as.logical()      # to logical type

as.integer()      # to integer type
as.double()       # to double type
as.numeric()      # to numeric type

as.character()    # to character type
```

## Vectorization

-   In R, **vectorization** means when we apply a function or operation on a vector, it will be done element by element automatically.

-   This means we do not need to loop through the vector.

```{r}

x <- c(4, 9, 25, 49)
sqrt(x)
#> [1] 2 3 5 7

#       x:      4        8         25         49
# sqrt(x): sqrt(4)  sqrt(8)   sqrt(25)   sqrt(49)
#  output:      2        3          5          7
```

-   Vectorization also implies that an operation on two vectors will be done in an element-wise manner.

```{r}

x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
y <- c(3, 5, 6, 2)
x + y
#> [1] 4 7 9 6

#      x:  1  2  3  4
#          +  +  +  +
#      y:  3  5  6  2
# output:  4  7  9  6
```

**Hands-On**

Verify the properties of vectorization with the following code

```{r}

x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
y <- c(3, 5, 6, 2)

x - y

x * y

y / x

log(y)

sin(x)
```

## Recycling

-   When performing operations on two vectors are different lengths, R will **recycle** the shorter vector to match the length of the longer one.

```{r}

x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
x * 2

#      x: 1  2  3  4
#         *  *  *  *
#         2  2  2  2
# output: 2  4  6  8
```

-   Recycling can produce confusing results, so it is recommended that two vectors either have the same length or that one of them has length 1.

**Hands-On**

Try the following R code and see what it returns. What do you think this sneaky code does?

```{r}

# Please avoid!

x <- c(5, 3, 7, 4, 6, 8, 3)
y <- c(1, 2)
x + y
```

**Answer:**

```{r}

### R code here
```

## Working with logical vectors

-   **Logical vectors** are frequently used in data analysis to account for different conditions.

```{r}

# logical vector
c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
c(T, F, F, T, T)
```

### Comparison operators

-   A logical vector can be created using **comparison operators**.

|                      |                          |
|:---------------------|:-------------------------|
| **Logical Operator** | **Description**          |
| `<`                  | Less than                |
| `<=`                 | Less than or equal to    |
| `>`                  | Greater than             |
| `>=`                 | Greater than or equal to |
| `==`                 | Exactly equal to         |
| `!=`                 | Not equal to             |

```{r}

x <- c(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3)

x < 0     # less than

x <= 0    # less than or equal to

x > 0     # greater than

x >= 0    # greater than or equal to

x == 0    # exactly equal to
 
x != 0    # not equal to
```

**Hands-On**

Consider daily high temperatures in celsius over two weeks. Write R code to answer the following questions:

-   Which days had temperatures **at least 30°C**?

-   Which days had temperatures **exactly equal to 19°C**?

-   Which days had temperatures **below 20°C**?

-   Which days had temperatures **greater than 25°C**?

-   Which days had temperatures **at most 22°C**?

```{r}

# Daily high temperatures over two weeks
temps <- c(
  Mon02 = 18, Tue03 = 21, Wed04 = 19, Thu05 = 25, Fri06 = 27, Sat07 = 30, Sun08 = 22, 
  Mon09 = 20, Tue10 = 16, Wed11 = 24, Thu12 = 28, Fri13 = 31, Sat14 = 29, Sun15 = 17
)
```

**Answer:**

```{r}

### R code here

```

### The `sum()` function

-   Applying the `sum()` function to a logical vector gives the number of `TRUE` values.

-   Recall that implicit coercion turns logical values to $1$'s and $0$'s.

```{r}

v <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
sum(v)
#> [1] 3
```

**Hands-On**

Try the following R code and see what it returns.

```{r}

x <- c(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3)

sum(x < 0)

sum(x <= 0)

sum(x > 0)

sum(x >= 0)

sum(x == 0)

sum(x != 0)
```

which(x >= 0)

which(x == 0)

which(x != 0)
```

**Answer:**

```{r}

### Relational operators

-   **Relational operators** are powerful tools to combine conditional statements

|                           |                 |
|:--------------------------|:----------------|
| **Relationship Operator** | **Description** |
| &                         | and             |
| \|                        | or              |

## Subsetting

-   Certain elements of a vector can be subsetted using the brackets `[]`

![](https://github.com/hungtong/DS-01-101/blob/main/image/2_vector_index.png?raw=true)

-   Subsetting can be done using one of the following indexing methods:

    -   Numeric indexing
    
    -   Logical indexing
    
    -   Character indexing (if the vector has names; not covered here)

## Numeric indexing

-   Numeric indexing means telling R the specific indices to return values.

```{r}

#       1   2   3   4   5   6   7
v <- c(70, 66, 82, 85, 78, 90, 73)

v[1]            # 1st value

v[4]            # 4th value

v[length(v)]    # last value, 7th value

v[320]          # Not available
```

-   Numeric indexing can also use a vector of multiple indices.

```{r}

#       1   2   3   4   5   6   7
v <- c(70, 66, 82, 85, 78, 90, 73)

v[2:5]                 # at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th

v[5:2]                 # at 5th, 4th, 3rd, 2nd

v[c(3, 1, 3, 5, 2)]    # at 3rd, 1st, 3rd, 5th, 2nd
```

-   Note that negative indices mean all but the specified indices.

```{r}

#       1   2   3   4   5   6   7
v <- c(70, 66, 82, 85, 78, 90, 73)

v[-1]                    # all but 1st value

v[-c(2, 5)]              # all but 2nd and 5th values

v[-(1:4)]                # all but 1st to 4th values

v[-1:4]                  # error!
```

**Hands-On**

Write R code to return the following in `v`

-   The second value

-   The sixth value

-   The first and last values.

-   The values at positions 3 through 6

-   The values at positions 6 through 3

-   The values at positions 1, 4, and 7

-   All values except the first.

-   All values except the last two.

-   All values except positions 2 and 6.

```{r}

#       1   2   3   4   5   6   7
v <- c(70, 66, 82, 85, 78, 90, 73)
```

**Answer:**

```{r}

### R code here

```

## Logical Indexing

-   **Logical indexing** means telling R which values to return and which values not to return.

-   With logical indexing, `TRUE` will retain the elements, while `FALSE` will discard the elements.

-   Logical indexing is powerful because it allows for subsetting with conditions.

```{r}

#       1   2   3   4   5   6   7
v <- c(70, 66, 82, 85, 78, 90, 73)

v[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)]    # 1st, 6th

v[c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)]     # 2nd, 3rd, 4th

v[v > 80]    # those values greater than 80
```

**Hands-On**

Use numeric and logical indexing to subset

-   `66 82 90 73`

-   `70 66 78 73`

```{r}

#       1   2   3   4   5   6   7
v <- c(70, 66, 82, 85, 78, 90, 73)
```
