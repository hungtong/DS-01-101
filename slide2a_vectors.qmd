| Vector     |     1     |       Yes        |
| Factor     |     1     |       Yes        |
| Matrix     |     2     |       Yes        |
| Data Frame |     2     |        No        |

## Vectors

-   A **vector** is a sequence of elements that are of the [same]{.underline} **atomic** **type**.

-   An **atomic type** refers to the six fundamental types in R: `logical`, `integer`, `double`, `character`, `raw`, and `complex`.

-   In R, a single value is treated as a vector of one element, and the index of the first element is always **1**.

## Vectors

```{r}

# logical vector
c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
c(T, F, F, T, T)

# integer vector (numeric)
c(1L, 3L, 2L, 4L, 2L)

# double vector (numeric)
c(6.3, 8.2, 3.1, 4.4, 7.6)

# character vector
c("apple", "orange", "apple", "apple", "orange")  
c('dog', 'cat', 'dog', 'dog', 'cat')  

# raw and complex exist but not very popular
```

## Vectors

-   The functions `typeof()` and `storage.mode()` tells us the atomic type of a vector.

-   The function `mode()` works similarly, except that it returns `numeric` for both `integer` and `double`

-   There are also dedicated checking function for each atomic type.

```{r}

is.logical()

is.integer()    # integer but not double
is.double()     # double but not integer
is.numeric()    # either integer or double

is.character()
```

## Your Turn

What does the following R code return?

```{r}

enrollment <- c(10, 30, 15, 20)

typeof(enrollment)

storage.mode(enrollment)

mode(enrollment)

is.integer(enrollment)

is.double(enrollment)

is.numeric(enrollment)   
```

## Answer

```{r}
enrollment <- c(10, 30, 15, 20)    # must be 10L, 30L, 15L to be integer

typeof(enrollment)
#> "double"

storage.mode(enrollment)
#> "double"

mode(enrollment)
#> "numeric"

is.integer(enrollment)
#> FALSE

is.double(enrollment)
#> TRUE

is.numeric(enrollment)   
#> TRUE
```

## Special Values

-   `NULL` indicates an undefined object

-   `NA` indicates missing or "not available" value

-   `NaN` indicates an object that is "not a number"

-   `Inf` indicates positive infinite

-   `-Inf` indicates negative infinite

## Your Turn

Try the following R code to see what it returns

```{r}

sqrt(-7)

log(-5)

0 / 0

100 / 0

-100 / 0

log(0)
```

## Answer

```{r}

# NaN
sqrt(-7)
log(-5)
0 / 0

# Inf
100 / 0

# -Inf
-100 / 0
log(0)
```

## Creating Vectors

-   As shown previously, a vector can be manually created using the combine c() function.

```{r}

# logical vector
c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
c(T, F, F, T, T)

# integer vector (numeric)
c(1L, 3L, 2L, 4L, 2L)

# double vector (numeric)
c(6.3, 8.2, 3.1, 4.4, 7.6)

# character vector
c("apple", "orange", "apple", "apple", "orange")  
c('dog', 'cat', 'dog', 'dog', 'cat') 
```

## Creating Vectors

-   Elements in a vector can have names!

```{r}

# Give names directly in c()
c(exam1 = 90, exam2 = 85, final = 92)

# Create a variable and assign names later
scores <- c(90, 85, 92)
names(scores) <- c('exam1', 'exam2', 'exam3')
scores

#> exam1 exam2 exam3 
#>    90    85    92
```

## Your Turn

-   Use `c()` to create a short vector for each of the four atomic types: integer, double, logical, and character.

-   Assign each vector to a variable with a descriptive name.

-   Choose one of your vectors and assign names to its elements.

## Creating Numeric Vectors

-   The colon operator `:` generate a numeric sequence of one-unit steps by

```{r}

### start:end (end is like an upper/lower bound)

-2:5
#> [1] -2 -1  0  1  2  3  4  5

5:-2
#> [1]  5  4  3  2  1  0 -1 -2

3.7:11.2
#> [1]  3.7  4.7  5.7  6.7  7.7  8.7  9.7 10.7

11.2:3.7
#> [1] 11.2 10.2  9.2  8.2  7.2  6.2  5.2  4.2
```

## Creating Numeric Vectors

-   The function `seq()` generates a numeric sequence of more general steps.

```{r}

seq(from = -2, to = 5)
#> [1] -2 -1  0  1  2  3  4  5

seq(from = -2, to = 5, by = 2)
#> [1] -2  0  2  4

seq(from = -2, to = 5, by = 0.75)
#> [1] -2.00 -1.25 -0.50  0.25  1.00  1.75  2.50  3.25  4.00  4.75

seq(from = -2, to = 5, length.out = 6)    # steps are automatically adjusted
#> [1] -2.0 -0.6  0.8  2.2  3.6  5.0
```

## Your Turn

Use the `seq()` function to create the vector that

-   Starts at `5` and ends at `-3`, increasing or decreasing by `1`

-   Starts at `-1` and ends at `7`, with a step size of `1.5`.

-   Starts at `0` and ends at `10`, containing `5` equally spaced values.

-   Starts at `-4` and ends at `4`, including only every other number.

## Creating Numeric Vectors

-   The function `rep()` creates vectors with repeated elements

```{r}

rep(-1, times = 5)
#> [1] -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

rep(c(-1, 0, 2), times = 4) 
#> [1] -1  0  2 -1  0  2 -1  0  2 -1  0  2

rep(c(-1, 0, 3), times = c(2, 3, 4))
#> -1 -1  0  0  0  3  3  3  3

rep(c(-1, 0, 3), each = 5)
#> [1] -1 -1 -1 -1 -1  0  0  0  0  0  3  3  3  3  3
```

## Your Turn

Use the `rep()` function to create the vector in which

-   Each value in the vector `c(1, 3, 6)` is repeated exactly 4 times

-   The value `4` is repeated `6` times

-   The vector `c(2, −1, 1)` is repeated `3` times

-   The values in `c(5, 0, −2)` are repeated so that `5` appears once, `0` appears three times, and `-2` appears four times.
