## Reading data from the clipboard

A data frame can be made by reading from the clipboard as follows:

-   Select and copy the content from a data file

    ![](https://github.com/hungtong/DS-01-101/blob/main/image/3_loan50.png?raw=true)

-   Use the `read.delim()` function

```{r}
read.delim('clipboard')
```

## Importing data with `read.table()` and `read.csv()`

-   Small and medium-size data sets are usually stored in a **text file** `.txt`

-   Data in a text file are separated by a **delimiter** such as white space, comma, tab, or semi-colon.

-   A text file in which data are separated by a comma is equivalent to a **comma-separated value** file `.csv`, which is commonly used in statistics and data science due to portability.

```{r}

### comma-separated value

floor,bed,lease,pool,rent
first,0,9,yes,1200
second,1,12,no,1550
first,2,12,yes,1900
second,1,9,no,1650
first,0,12,yes,1300
```

-   The `read.table()` function is a general function to read data from a text file. Before using the function, it is best to move the text file under the current working directory.

```{r}
read.table('file_name.csv', header = TRUE, sep = ' ')

read.table('file_name.csv', header = TRUE, sep = ',')

read.table('file_name.csv', header = TRUE, sep = '\t')

read.table('file_name.csv', header = TRUE, sep = ';')
```

-   The `read.csv()` function is just a wrapper of the `read.table()` function for importing comma-separated value file `.csv`

```{r}
read.csv('file_name.csv')    # same as read.table('file_name.csv', sep = ',')
```

## Inspecting a data frame

Given a data frame,

-   `str()` shows its overall structure

-   `head()` returns its first few rows

-   `tail()` returns its last few rows

-   `dim()` returns a vector dimensions

-   `nrow()` returns its number of rows

-   `ncol()` returns its number of columns

-   `colnames()` and `names()` returns its column names

-   `rownames()` returns its row names

-   `summary()` shows descriptive statistics for its columns

-   `complete.cases()` returns a logical vector indicating which observations have no missing values.

**Hands-On**

Inspect the `iris` data.

**Answer:**

```{r}

```

**Hands-On**

Import and inspect the `loan50` data from [OpenIntro](https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=loan50).

> This data set represents 50 loans made through the Lending Club platform, which is a platform that allows individuals to lend to other individuals. Of course, not all loans are created equal. Someone who is a essentially a sure bet to pay back a loan will have an easier time getting a loan with a low interest rate than someone who appears to be riskier. And for people who are very risky? They may not even get a loan offer, or they may not have accepted the loan offer due to a high interest rate.

-   `state` - Two-letter state code.

-   `emp_length` - Number of years in the job, rounded down. If longer than 10 years, then this is represented by the value 10.

-   `term` - The number of months of the loan the applicant received.

-   `home_ownership` - The ownership status of the applicant's residence.

-   `annual_income` - Annual income.

-   `verified_income` - Type of verification of the applicant's income.

-   `debt_to_income` - Debt-to-income ratio.

-   `total_credit_limit` - Total available credit, e.g. if only credit cards, then the total of all the credit limits. This excludes a mortgage.

-   `total_credit_utilized` - Total credit balance, excluding a mortgage.

-   `num_cc_carrying_balance` - Number of credit cards that are carrying a balance.

-   `loan_amount` - The amount of the loan the applicant received.

-   `grade` - Grade associated with the loan.

-   `interest_rate` - Interest rate of the loan the applicant received.

-   `public_record_bankrupt` - Number of bankruptcies listed in the public record for this applicant.

-   `loan_status` - Status of the loan.

-   `has_second_income` - Whether the applicant has a secondary income.

-   `total_income` - The applicant's total income.

```{r}

```

## Storing data with `write.table()` and `write.csv()`

-   To export a data frame to `.txt` or `.csv` files, we can use the `write.table()` and `write.csv()` functions with different delimiters.

```{r}
write.table(data_to_store, file = 'file_name.txt', sep = '')

write.table(data_to_store, file = 'file_name.txt', sep = '\t')

write.csv(data_to_store, file = 'file_name.csv')
```

**Hands-On**

Export loans that are fully paid from the `loan50` data to `.txt` or `.csv` files.

**Answer:**

```{r}

### R code here
```

## Storing objects with `dput()`

-   The `dput()` function writes an R object in a plain-text format that can be used to reproduce the object.

```{r}
dput(some_object)
```

**Hands-On**

Write loans that are fully paid from the `loan50` data in a plain-text format.

**Answer:**

```{r}

### R code here
```

## Storing objects with `save()`

-   The `save()` allows us to store multiple objects in `.rdata` or `.rda`.

```{r}
save(object1, object2, object3, file = 'file_name.rdata')
```

**Hands-On**

Identify the following objects from the `loan50` data and store them in `.rdata`

-   `loan_mortgage` - loans associated with homeownership that is mortgatge

-   `loan_20k` - loans with the loan amount at least $20,000$

-   `loan_low_interest` - loans with interest rate less than $7\%$

**Answer:**

```{r}

### R code here
```

## Miscellaneous functions

-   `ls()` shows all the created objects

-   `rm()` removes certain objects

-   `getwd()` returns the file path of the current working directory

-   `setwd()` sets a new working directory
